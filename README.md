# oop_in_c

Practice project while reading "Application Note Object-Oriented Programming in C"

### Reason

Well, as I have to use only C for my first projects in [UNIT Factory], I've decided
to find a way to write in OOP. It is a very useful as the mechanism of organizing
code, especially for graphics projects.

### :exclamation:Note

Some of code here should look weird. This is because of [The Norm][42_Norm] - 
a set of rules which are mandatory for projects in C in [UNIT Factory]
